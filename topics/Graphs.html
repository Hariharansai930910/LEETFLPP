Problem:
Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def numIslands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0

    def dfs(r, c):
        if r &lt; 0 or r &gt;= len(grid) or c &lt; 0 or c &gt;= len(grid[0]) or grid[r][c] == '0':
            return
        grid[r][c] = '0'  # Mark as visited
        dfs(r + 1, c)
        dfs(r - 1, c)
        dfs(r, c + 1)
        dfs(r, c - 1)

    count = 0
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[r][c] == '1':
                dfs(r, c)
                count += 1
    return count
Time Complexity: O(M Ã— N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is visited once.

Space Complexity: O(M Ã— N) in the worst case for the recursion stack.


. Number of Islands
âœ… One-liner:
Use DFS to flood-fill land and count how many times it starts.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
See land? Dive in and mark all connected land.
Go up, down, left, right â€” turn it to water.
Count how many dives you did!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Land found â†’ dive!&quot; â†’ if grid[r][c] == '1': dfs(r, c); count += 1
&quot;Flood fill&quot; â†’ grid[r][c] = '0'
&quot;Recursive splash&quot; â†’ dfs(r + 1, c), dfs(r - 1, c), dfs(r, c + 1), dfs(r, c - 1)




2. Max Area of Island
Problem:
Given a 2D grid of 0's (water) and 1's (land), find the maximum area of an island in the grid.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def maxAreaOfIsland(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0

    def dfs(r, c):
        if r &lt; 0 or r &gt;= len(grid) or c &lt; 0 or c &gt;= len(grid[0]) or grid[r][c] == 0:
            return 0
        grid[r][c] = 0  # Mark as visited
        return 1 + dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r - 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1) + dfs(r, c - 1)

    max_area = 0
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[r][c] == 1:
                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(r, c))
    return max_area
Time Complexity: O(M Ã— N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is visited once.

Space Complexity: O(M Ã— N) in the worst case for the recursion stack.
2. Max Area of Island
âœ… One-liner:
DFS to count connected land areas and track the max size.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Explore each island like a treasure map.
Count each land you step on.
Keep the biggest number!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Step on land&quot; â†’ return 1 + dfs(...) + ...
&quot;Sink it&quot; â†’ grid[r][c] = 0
&quot;Track best&quot; â†’ max_area = max(max_area, dfs(r, c))



3. Clone Graph
Problem:
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, neighbors=None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

def cloneGraph(node):
    if not node:
        return None

    old_to_new = {}

    def dfs(node):
        if node in old_to_new:
            return old_to_new[node]
        copy = Node(node.val)
        old_to_new[node] = copy
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            copy.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
        return copy

    return dfs(node)
Time Complexity: O(N + M), where N is the number of nodes and M is the number of edges. Each node and edge is visited once.

Space Complexity: O(N), to store the mapping of old nodes to new nodes.

3. Clone Graph
âœ… One-liner:
Use DFS and a hashmap to copy each node and its neighbors.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Copy the node. Then copy its friends.
Donâ€™t copy the same kid twice!
Use a notebook to remember who you copied.

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Memoize node&quot; â†’ old_to_new[node] = copy
&quot;Visit neighbors&quot; â†’ copy.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
&quot;Return copy&quot; â†’ return old_to_new[node]

4. Walls and Gates
Problem:
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, leave the room's value as INF.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
from collections import deque

def wallsAndGates(rooms):
    if not rooms:
        return

    rows, cols = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
    queue = deque()

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if rooms[r][c] == 0:
                queue.append((r, c))

    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            rr, cc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 &lt;= rr &lt; rows and 0 &lt;= cc &lt; cols and rooms[rr][cc] == float('inf'):
                rooms[rr][cc] = rooms[r][c] + 1
                queue.append((rr, cc))
Time Complexity: O(M Ã— N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is processed once.

Space Complexity: O(M Ã— N) for the queue in the worst case.

. Walls and Gates
âœ… One-liner:
Use BFS from every gate to fill rooms with the shortest distance.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Start walking from every open gate.
Step by step, add 1 to your count.
Stop if you hit a wall!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Start from gates&quot; â†’ if rooms[r][c] == 0: queue.append((r, c))
&quot;Step update&quot; â†’ rooms[rr][cc] = rooms[r][c] + 1
&quot;BFS directions&quot; â†’ for dr, dc in [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]



5. Rotting Oranges
Problem:
Given a grid of oranges, determine the minimum time required for all oranges to become rotten. If impossible, return -1.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit

    if not grid:
        return -1

    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

            elif grid[r][c] == 1:
                fresh_oranges += 1

    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    minutes = 0

    while queue:
        r, c, minutes = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:

                grid[rr][cc] = 2
                fresh_oranges -= 1
                queue.append((rr, cc, minutes + 1))

    return minutes if fresh_oranges == 0 else -1
Time Complexity: O(M Ã— N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is processed once.

Space Complexity: O(M Ã— N) for the queue in the worst case.

5. Rotting Oranges
âœ… One-liner:
Use BFS to spread rot from all rotten oranges minute by minute.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Rotten oranges spread the stink.
Each minute, they infect their neighbors.
If any fresh ones are left, return -1!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Start with all rotten&quot; â†’ if grid[r][c] == 2: queue.append((r, c, 0))
&quot;Spread the rot&quot; â†’ grid[rr][cc] = 2
&quot;Track time&quot; â†’ minutes = max(minutes, cur_minute)

        dfs(i, n - 1, atlantic, heights[i][n - 1])
    for j in range(n):
        dfs(0, j, pacific, heights[0][j])
        dfs(m - 1, j, atlantic, heights[m - 1][j])

    return list(pacific &amp; atlantic)
Time Complexity: O(m Ã— n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Each cell is processed at most twice, once for each ocean.

Space Complexity: O(m Ã— n) for the pacific and atlantic sets and the recursion stack.


6. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
âœ… One-liner:
DFS from both ocean edges to find cells that can reach both.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:

            elif board[i][j] == '#':
                board[i][j] = 'O'
Time Complexity: O(m Ã— n), as each cell is processed at most twice.

Space Complexity: O(m Ã— n) for the recursion stack in the worst case.

7. Surrounded Regions
âœ… One-liner:
Use DFS to mark safe â€˜Oâ€™s on the border, then flip the rest.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Mark the border Oâ€™s as safe.
Flip all trapped Oâ€™s to X.
Flip the safe ones back.

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Safe marker&quot; â†’ board[r][c] = '#'
&quot;Flip trapped&quot; â†’ if board[i][j] == 'O': board[i][j] = 'X'
&quot;Restore safe&quot; â†’ if board[i][j] == '#': board[i][j] = 'O'
