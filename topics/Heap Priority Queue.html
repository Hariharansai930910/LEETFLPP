### 1. **Kth Largest Element in a Stream**

**Problem:**  
Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream.

**Solution:**
```python
import heapq

class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k, nums):
        self.k = k
        self.min_heap = nums
        heapq.heapify(self.min_heap)
        while len(self.min_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)

    def add(self, val):
        heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, val)
        if len(self.min_heap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)
        return self.min_heap[0]
```

**Time Complexity:**
- `__init__`: O(N log N), where N is the length of `nums` (heapify operation).
- `add`: O(log k) per addition (heap push and pop operations).

**Space Complexity:** O(k) (to store the heap of size k).


### 1. **Kth Largest Element in a Stream**

**âœ… One-liner:**  
Maintain a min-heap of size `k` to track the Kth largest element.

**ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:**  
We keep the biggest `k` numbers in a bucket.  
We throw out the smallest one if we get too many.  
The Kth largest is always the smallest in our bucket.

**ðŸ§  Mnemonics:**
- "Push to heap" â†’ `heapq.heappush(self.heap, val)`
- "Pop if oversized" â†’ `if len(self.heap) > k: heapq.heappop(self.heap)`
- "Return Kth" â†’ `return self.heap[0]`

### 2. **Last Stone Weight**

**Problem:**  
Simulate a process where the two heaviest stones are smashed together until only one or zero stones remain.

**Solution:**
```python
import heapq

def lastStoneWeight(stones):
    stones = [-s for s in stones]
    heapq.heapify(stones)
    while len(stones) > 1:
        first = -heapq.heappop(stones)
        second = -heapq.heappop(stones)
        if first != second:
            heapq.heappush(stones, -(first - second))
    return -stones[0] if stones else 0
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N log N), where N is the number of stones (heap operations for each stone).

**Space Complexity:** O(N) (to store the heap).


### 2. **Last Stone Weight**

**âœ… One-liner:**  
Use a max-heap (invert numbers) to always smash the heaviest stones.

**ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:**  
We take the two heaviest stones.  
If theyâ€™re different, we smash and put the leftover back.  
We keep doing that until one or zero stones are left.

**ðŸ§  Mnemonics:**
- "Max heap" â†’ `heap = [-x for x in stones]`
- "Pop two largest" â†’ `a = -heapq.heappop(heap), b = -heapq.heappop(heap)`
- "Push back if diff" â†’ `if a != b: heapq.heappush(heap, -(a - b))`

### 3. **K Closest Points to Origin**

**Problem:**  
Find the k closest points to the origin (0, 0) from a list of points.

**Solution:**
```python
import heapq

def kClosest(points, k):
    heap = []
    for (x, y) in points:
        dist = -(x**2 + y**2)
        if len(heap) < k:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (dist, x, y))
        else:
            heapq.heappushpop(heap, (dist, x, y))
    return [(x, y) for (dist, x, y) in heap]
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the number of points (heap operations for each point).

**Space Complexity:** O(k) (to store the heap of size k).

### 3. **K Closest Points to Origin**

**âœ… One-liner:**  
Use a max-heap of size `k` with negative distances.

**ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:**  
We find how far each point is from the center.  
We keep only the closest `k` ones.  
At the end, we give back those points.

**ðŸ§  Mnemonics:**
- "Calculate dist" â†’ `dist = x*x + y*y`
- "Max heap trick" â†’ `heapq.heappush(heap, (-dist, (x, y)))`
- "Pop if > k" â†’ `if len(heap) > k: heapq.heappop(heap)`

### 4. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**

**Problem:**  
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.

**Solution:**
```python
import heapq

def findKthLargest(nums, k):
    return heapq.nlargest(k, nums)[-1]
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the number of elements in `nums` (heap operations for each element).

**Space Complexity:** O(k) (to store the heap of size k).

### 4. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**

**âœ… One-liner:**  
Use a min-heap of size `k` to track top elements.

**ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:**  
We look through all the numbers.  
We keep a bucket with the largest `k` ones.  
The smallest in that bucket is the answer.

**ðŸ§  Mnemonics:**
- "Push to heap" â†’ `heapq.heappush(heap, num)`
- "Trim to k size" â†’ `if len(heap) > k: heapq.heappop(heap)`
- "Return top" â†’ `return heap[0]`

### 5. **Task Scheduler**

**Problem:**  
Given a list of tasks with cooldown intervals, find the minimum time required to execute all tasks.

**Solution:**
```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def leastInterval(tasks, n):
    task_counts = Counter(tasks)
    max_heap = [-cnt for cnt in task_counts.values()]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    time = 0
    while max_heap:
        temp = []
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            if max_heap:
                temp.append(heapq.heappop(max_heap))
        for item in temp:
            if item + 1 < 0:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, item + 1)
        time += n + 1 if max_heap else len(temp)
    return time
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of tasks.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) (since the task frequency array has at most 26 elements).



### 5. **Task Scheduler**

**âœ… One-liner:**  
Use a greedy strategy with a max-heap and cooldown logic.

**ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:**  
We want to do tasks without repeating too soon.  
We do the most frequent task first.  
If we wait, we fill gaps with idle time.

**ðŸ§  Mnemonics:**
- "Count tasks" â†’ `freq = Counter(tasks)`
- "Max heap" â†’ `heap = [-cnt for cnt in freq.values()]`
- "Cooldown cycle" â†’ `for i in range(n + 1): fill tasks or idle`

### 6. **Design Twitter**

**Problem:**  
Design a simplified version of Twitter with basic functionalities.

**Solution:**
```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Twitter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.time = 0
        self.tweets = defaultdict(deque)
        self.followees = defaultdict(set)

    def postTweet(self, userId, tweetId):
        self.tweets[userId].appendleft((self.time, tweetId))
        self.time += 1

    def getNewsFeed(self, userId):
        heap = []
        self.followees[userId].add(userId)
        for followee in self.followees[userId]:
            for tweet in self.tweets[followee]:
                heapq.heappush(heap, tweet)
                if len(heap) > 10:
                    heapq.heappop(heap)
        result = []
        while heap:
            result.append(heapq.heappop(heap)[1])
        return result[::-1]

    def follow(self, followerId, followeeId):
        self.followees[followerId].add(followeeId)

    def unfollow(self, followerId, followeeId):
        self.followees[followerId].discard(followeeId)
```

**Time Complexity:**
- `postTweet`: O(1)
- `getNewsFeed`: O(F + T log T), where F is the number of followees and T is the total number of tweets.
- `follow`/`unfollow`: O(1)

**Space Complexity:** O(U + T), where U is the number of users and T is the total number of tweets.

### 6. **Design Twitter**

**âœ… One-liner:**  
Use a heap to get the 10 most recent tweets across users.

**ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:**  
Each user has their own tweet list.  
We mix them and keep only the latest 10.  
We also track who follows whom.

**ðŸ§  Mnemonics:**
- "Tweet store" â†’ `self.tweets = {user: []}`
- "Heap feed" â†’ `heapq.heappush(heap, (-time, tweet))`
- "Follows set" â†’ `self.followees[user].add(followee)`

### 7. **Find Median from Data Stream**

**Problem:**  
Continuously find the median from a stream of numbers.

**Solution:**
```python
import heapq

class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.small = []  # Max heap (inverted min heap)
        self.large = []  # Min heap

    def addNum(self, num):
        heapq.heappush(self.small, -num)
        if (self.small and self.large and
                (-self.small[0] > self.large[0])):
            heapq.heappush(self.large, -heapq.heappop(self.small))
        if len(self.small) > len(self.large) + 1:
            heapq.heappush(self.large, -heapq.heappop(self.small))
        if len(self.large) > len(self.small):
            heapq.heappush(self.small, -heapq.heappop(self.large))

    def findMedian(self):
        if len(self.small) > len(self.large):
            return -self.small[0]
        return (-self.small[0] + self.large[0]) / 2
```

**Time Complexity:**
- `addNum`: O(log N), where N is the number of elements added.
- `findMedian`: O(1)

**Space Complexity:** O(N) (to store 
### 7. **Find Median From Data Stream**

**âœ… One-liner:**  
Use two heaps (max-heap + min-heap) to balance lower and upper halves.

**ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:**  
We keep small numbers on one side, big ones on the other.  
The middle is easy to find when both sides are balanced.  
We add numbers and move between sides as needed.

**ðŸ§  Mnemonics:**
- "Two heaps" â†’ `small = MaxHeap`, `large = MinHeap`
- "Balance heaps" â†’ `if len(small) > len(large): move one over`
- "Get median" â†’ `return (top of small + top of large) / 2`
