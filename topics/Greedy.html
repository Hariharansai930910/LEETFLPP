Problem:
Find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def maxSubArray(nums):
    current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum
Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ We iterate through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ We use a constant amount of extra space.

1. Maximum Subarray
âœ… One-liner:
Use Kadaneâ€™s algorithm to track the best subarray sum ending at each index.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Add each number to your score.
If it hurts more than helps, start fresh.
Keep the highest score!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Choose max path&quot; â†’ current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
&quot;Track highest&quot; â†’ max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

2. Jump Game
Problem:
Given an array of non-negative integers nums, where each element represents your maximum jump length at that position, determine if you can reach the last index.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def canJump(nums):
    max_reach = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if i &gt; max_reach:
            return False
        max_reach = max(max_reach, i + num)
    return True
Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ We iterate through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ We use a constant amount of extra space.
2. Jump Game
âœ… One-liner:
Track the furthest index reachable at every step.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Jump from stone to stone.
If you canâ€™t reach one, stop.
Go as far as you can!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Too far to jump?&quot; â†’ if i &gt; max_reach: return False
&quot;Keep extending&quot; â†’ max_reach = max(max_reach, i + num)


3. Jump Game II
Problem:
Given an array of non-negative integers nums, where each element represents your maximum jump length at that position, find the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def jump(nums):
    jumps = current_end = farthest = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
        if i == current_end:
            jumps += 1
            current_end = farthest
    return jumps
Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ We iterate through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ We use a constant amount of extra space.
3. Jump Game II
âœ… One-liner:
Count jumps when current range ends and extend to farthest.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Each jump gets you closer to the goal.
Wait till you run out of steps.
Then take the next big jump!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Track farthest&quot; â†’ farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
&quot;Jump when needed&quot; â†’ if i == current_end: jumps += 1; current_end = farthest


4. Gas Station
Problem:
There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the i-th station is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the i-th station to its next (i + 1)th station. Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost):
    total_tank = current_tank = start_index = 0
    for i in range(len(gas)):
        total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
        current_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
        if current_tank &lt; 0:
            start_index = i + 1
            current_tank = 0
    return start_index if total_tank &gt;= 0 else -1
Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ We iterate through the arrays once.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ We use a constant amount of extra space.

4. Gas Station
âœ… One-liner:
Track total gas vs cost and reset start when running dry.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Drive your toy car around the track.
If you run out, try the next start.
If thereâ€™s more gas than cost, youâ€™ll make it!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Reset on empty&quot; â†’ if current_tank &lt; 0: start_index = i + 1; current_tank = 0
&quot;Check total&quot; â†’ return start_index if total_tank &gt;= 0 else -1

5. Hand of Straights
Problem:
Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers. She wants to rearrange the cards into groups of groupSize consecutive cards. Return true if and only if she can.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize):
    if len(hand) % groupSize != 0:
        return False

    count = Counter(hand)
    min_heap = list(count.keys())
    heapq.heapify(min_heap)

    while min_heap:
        first = min_heap[0]
        for i in range(first, first + groupSize):
            if count[i] == 0:
                return False
            count[i] -= 1
            if count[i] == 0:
                if i != min_heap[0]:
                    return False
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
    return True
Time Complexity: O(n log n) â€“ Sorting the hand contributes O(n log n), and processing the cards contributes O(n).
Space Complexity: O(n) â€“ We use a counter to store the frequency of each card.




5. Hand of Straights
âœ… One-liner:
Use a min-heap to form straight hands from smallest cards.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Group cards into stairs like 3-4-5.
Start with the smallest step.
If a step is missing, the group falls!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Build stair group&quot; â†’ for i in range(first, first + groupSize):
&quot;Check step&quot; â†’ if count[i] == 0: return False
&quot;Pop if done&quot; â†’ if count[i] == 0 and i == min_heap[0]: heapq.heappop(min_heap)


6. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet
Problem:
Given a list of triplets triplets and a target triplet target, return true if it is possible to select some triplets from the list and merge them to form the target triplet.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def mergeTriplets(triplets, target):
    good = set()
    for triplet in triplets:
        if all(triplet[i] &lt;= target[i] for i in range(3)):
            for i in range(3):
                if triplet[i] == target[i]:
                    good.add(i)
    return len(good) == 3
Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ We iterate through the triplets once.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ We use a constant amount of extra space.

6. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet
âœ… One-liner:
Pick only triplets â‰¤ target and track matched positions.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Each robot part must be same or smaller.
Find triplets that match one or more parts.
Collect all 3 to build your robot!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Filter valid&quot; â†’ if all(triplet[i] &lt;= target[i] for i in range(3)):
&quot;Track matches&quot; â†’ if triplet[i] == target[i]: good.add(i)

7. Partition Labels
Problem:
A string S of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def partitionLabels(S):
    last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(S)}
    j = anchor = 0
    result = []
    for i, c in enumerate(S):
        j = max(j, last[c])
        if i == j:
            result.append(i - anchor + 1)
            anchor = i + 1
    return result
Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ We iterate through the string twice.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ The space used for the dictionary is constant since there are at most 26 letters.

7. Partition Labels
âœ… One-liner:
Use each characterâ€™s last occurrence to determine cut points.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
You want to cut paper without repeating letters.
Wait until the last of all letters in the part.
Then make a cut!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Last seen&quot; â†’ last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(S)}
&quot;Cut when done&quot; â†’ if i == j: result.append(i - anchor + 1); anchor = i + 1


8. Valid Parenthesis String

Solution:

python
Copy
Edit
def checkValidString(s):
    low = high = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            low += 1
            high += 1
        elif char == ')

Here's the optimized Python code for Valid Parenthesis String (LeetCode 678), along with time and space complexity analysis:

âœ… Problem Summary:
You are given a string s containing only '(', ')', and '*'. A '*' can be treated as:

'('

')'

or an empty string ''

Determine if the string is valid based on proper parenthesis rules.

âœ… Optimized Python Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def checkValidString(s: str) -&gt; bool:
    low = high = 0  # Range of possible open parentheses count

    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            low += 1
            high += 1
        elif char == ')':
            low -= 1
            high -= 1
        else:  # char == '*'
            low -= 1   # treat '*' as ')'
            high += 1  # treat '*' as '('

        # Clamp low to 0 since we can't have negative open brackets
        if high &lt; 0:
            return False
        if low &lt; 0:
            low = 0

    return low == 0
âœ… Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)
We iterate through the string once.

Space Complexity: O(1)
Only two integer variables (low, high) are used, regardless of input size.

8. Valid Parenthesis String
âœ… One-liner:
Track a possible open-parentheses range with â€˜*â€™ as wildcard.

ðŸ‘¶ 3-liner for kids:
Youâ€™re stacking cups.
â€˜*â€™ can be a cup or nothing.
Just donâ€™t let the stack fall!

ðŸ§  Mnemonics:

&quot;Range tracking&quot; â†’ low -= 1; high += 1 (for *)
&quot;Clamp to zero&quot; â†’ if low &lt; 0: low = 0
&quot;Early exit&quot; â†’ if high &lt; 0: return False</pre>
